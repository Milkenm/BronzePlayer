### What is Bronze Player?
Bronze Player is a program I made for school projects and probably will continue making it. Why? Because I never found a good media player where I could create play lists, download from YT, bla bla bla...










# Releases
So, so... How my releases work... even I don't know.\
Releases are found [here](https://goo.gl/yWPT2H).



### This is the way im currently doing it:
**v.1.2.3-x**
* **1** is a major release, where there was a big big extremely big change in the program.
* **2**: is a big release, like when new stuff is added.
* **3**: is when that big stuff is fixed.
* **x**: replaced with *alpha* (the program is completly broken or some functionalities are WIP) or *beta* (there are known issues that impact main tasks (for example: after playing a song the program crashes)) release.
# Other stuff
### Typos
My main language is not English or nothing near that (I'm portuguese if you want to know), and you'll definitly find typing errors everywhere.
Sometimes I use Google, but like you probably know, sometimes the translations are completly out of context or the word mean something else.

If  you find any, [you can report it here](https://github.com/Milkenm/BronzePlayer/issues) on GitHub, even if it's a single '*i*' instead of *'I*'.





### Abbreviations
* **WIP**: **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress (when something isn't finished yet).
* **YTD**: **Y**ou**T**ube **D**ownloader (the YTD inside the project).
